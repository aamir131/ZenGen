Management call transcript:

`[00:00:00] **[Meeting Start]**

**Sarah (Manager):** Alright team, thanks for joining. Let's run through Europe Air Conditioning. How are we progressing?

**David (Senior Analyst):** Morning Sarah. We’ve got the initial data drop. It's… interesting. Bingley, West Yorkshire, right? Bit of a trek.

**Emily (Analyst):** Yeah, and the ownership structure. Four shareholders, equal splits, Europe Holdings (UK) Ltd. Gina Demuratas, Luigi Demurtas, Ian Dobson, and Nicole Dobson.

**Sarah:** Right, and they're all actively involved?

**David:** Not entirely. Luigi and Ian seem to be the ones running the show. Luigi handles the larger projects, Ian's more on the maintenance side.

**Emily:** Which, from what I can see, is a pretty significant part of their business. Planned Preventive Maintenance, or PPM, they call it.

[00:05:00] **Sarah:** Okay, PPM. What's the revenue breakdown looking like?

**David:** Installations are the big driver. Then there's the sales, quoted work, which is smaller, quicker jobs.

**Emily:** And they saw a big jump in a previous financial year.

**Sarah:** What drove that?

**David:** Delayed projects from the previous year, apparently. They mentioned some supply chain issues.

**Sarah:** Right, those were a nightmare for everyone. And then the most recent year?

**Emily:** Marginal growth. It seems like they hit a ceiling.

[00:10:00] **David:** Yeah, and their invoicing is a bit… varied. Large projects, they bill monthly or on completion stages. Smaller ones, it's on completion.

**Sarah:** And the WIP? How are they tracking that?

**Emily:** They give a summary to their accountants at year-end, estimated stage of completion.

**David:** Luigi oversees the larger projects, pricing-wise, and Ian handles the maintenance contracts. Fixed price for most things, I think.

**Sarah:** Okay, fixed price. That’s good, less room for surprises. What about the PPM contracts?

**Emily:** Rolling 12-month mostly, but some 24-month contracts are in there. Billing is a mix, monthly, quarterly, even annually. We've got the breakdown in Appendix E.

[00:15:00] **Sarah:** Right, I’ll take a look. Costs?

**David:** Direct costs, mainly wages and materials. They don’t rely much on subcontractors.

**Emily:** Which is surprising, given the growth. I thought they might have relied on extra labour.

**Sarah:** Yeah, that's something to dig into. Overheads?

**David:** Motor vehicles and subsistence are the biggest. It makes sense; they’ve got engineers on the road all the time.

**Emily:** And those costs went up in line with the revenue jump.

[00:20:00] **Sarah:** Makes sense. Any red flags?

**David:** A few. They had a bad debt write-off a couple of years ago. Two customers went into administration.

**Emily:** That's a significant amount.

**Sarah:** Definitely. And what about the gross margin?

**David:** Relatively stable.

**Sarah:** Okay, stable margins are good. What about the Demuratas and Dobson families? Do we have a sense of their relationship?

**David:** Seem fine on the surface. We haven’t seen any major disagreements in the minutes. Although, Luigi seems to have a lot of influence on the larger projects.

[00:25:00] **Emily:** And Ian seems to be the main point of contact for the day-to-day operations.

**Sarah:** Right. Any issues with the data provided?

**David:** Some of the documentation for the WIP calculations is a bit… sparse. We're requesting more detail.

**Emily:** And the billing schedules for the PPM contracts. Some are hand written, which is not ideal.

**Sarah:** Hand written? Seriously?

**David:** Yeah, apparently they’re transitioning to a new system, but it's been delayed.

**Sarah:** Of course. Anything else?

**David:** There’s a rumour about a potential expansion into renewable energy solutions. They’ve mentioned it a few times in passing.

[00:30:00] **Emily:** And they’ve been talking about a new warehouse in Leeds. It was on the minutes of a previous meeting.

**Sarah:** Leeds? That's a significant investment. We need more information on that.

**David:** Absolutely. We’re also looking into their regulatory compliance. They handle a lot of specialist work, so we need to make sure they’re up to date.

**Emily:** And the employee contracts. Some of them seem to be outdated. We need to check for any potential liabilities.

**Sarah:** Right, employee contracts, regulatory compliance, warehouse expansion, and the renewable energy rumour. We need to get more data on all of that.

[00:35:00] **David:** Agreed. We’ve also noticed some unusual fluctuations in the material costs for certain projects.

**Emily:** Yeah, it could be due to price volatility, but we need to investigate further.

**Sarah:** Okay, material cost fluctuations. Anything else?

**David:** One of the invoices we saw was for a client called 'Northern Breeze Solutions'. I can't find them in Companies House.

**Emily:** That's odd. Maybe a trading name?

**Sarah:** Could be. But we need to verify it. What about the customer concentration?

**David:** They have a few large clients, but it’s not overly concentrated. We’re still mapping out the key accounts.

[00:40:00] **Emily:** And we’re looking into the seasonality of their business. They mentioned peak periods during the summer for AC installations.

**Sarah:** Right, seasonality. That could impact their cash flow. What about the IT infrastructure?

**David:** They’re using a mix of legacy systems and some newer cloud-based software. It’s a bit of a patchwork.

**Emily:** And the data security is a concern. Some of the files we received were unencrypted.

**Sarah:** Unencrypted? That’s a red flag. We need to escalate that.

[00:45:00] **David:** Agreed. We’re also looking into their insurance policies. They handle some high-risk installations, so we need to make sure they’re adequately covered.

**Emily:** And the pension scheme. We need to check for any potential shortfalls.

**Sarah:** Right, pension scheme, insurance, IT infrastructure, data security. We’ve got a lot to cover. Any initial thoughts on the valuation?

**David:** It’s too early to say. The growth in a previous year is a bit of an outlier, so we need to see if that’s sustainable.

**Emily:** And the potential expansion into renewable energy could significantly impact their future revenue.

**Sarah:** Right, potential expansion. We need to get a better understanding of their strategic plans.

[00:50:00] **David:** And the relationship between the shareholders. We need to make sure there are no underlying conflicts.

**Emily:** And the handwritten PPM contracts. That’s a serious operational risk.

**Sarah:** Agreed. We need to address all of these issues in our report. Let’s schedule a follow-up call with management to get more information.

**David:** Sounds good.

**Emily:** I’ll draft a list of questions.

**Sarah:** Excellent. And let’s get a site visit scheduled. I want to see their operations firsthand.

[00:55:00] **David:** I’ll coordinate that.

**Emily:** And I’ll look into Northern Breeze Solutions.

**Sarah:** Great. Let’s keep this moving. We need to get this wrapped up quickly. Any final thoughts?

**David:** Just the warehouse in Leeds. We need to understand the financial implications.

**Emily:** And the renewable energy rumour. That could be a game-changer.

**Sarah:** Right, warehouse and renewable energy. Let’s prioritize those. Alright team, thanks for your hard work. Let’s reconvene tomorrow morning with an update.

[00:59:00] **[Meeting End]**`

`[00:00:00] **[Meeting Start]**

**Sarah (Manager):** Good morning Luigi, Ian, thanks for taking the time to meet with us again. We're making good progress with the due diligence on Europe Air Conditioning, but we have a few more detailed questions to help us understand the business better.

**Luigi (Management):** Morning Sarah, David, Emily. Happy to help in any way we can.

**Ian (Management):** Absolutely, fire away. We're an open book.

**Sarah:** Great. David, let's start with the revenue breakdown again. We've noticed the majority is from installations, but we'd like to delve deeper into the sales and quoted work. Specifically, what's the typical client profile for each, and what's the average project value?

**David (Senior Analyst):** Luigi, you mentioned the installations are longer-term projects, often large commercial or industrial clients. But what's the typical client for quoted work? Is it mostly residential, smaller businesses, or a mix? And what’s the average revenue per job?

**Luigi:** You're right, installations are usually larger scale - office blocks, hotels, that sort of thing.  Quoted work is much more varied. We get calls from homeowners, small offices, retail units, even the occasional school or local government building. It's a real mix. Average revenue?  Tough to say.  Could be anything from a few hundred quid for a simple repair to maybe £10,000 - £15,000 for a small office refit.

[00:05:00] **Emily (Analyst):** Following on from that, could you give us some more insight into how you price those quoted jobs?  Is it hourly rates plus materials, or do you have some kind of standardized pricing structure?

**Ian:** We have a system, definitely.  For standard call-outs and repairs, we have fixed hourly rates for our engineers, then we add on the cost of materials, plus a markup.  For larger quoted jobs, we'll do a more detailed estimate, taking into account the complexity of the work, any specialist equipment needed, and of course, the competitive landscape.

**Sarah:** That makes sense.  Now, regarding the significant revenue growth you experienced in [Financial Year], you attributed it to delayed projects.  Can you give us some more context on those delays? Were they localized to your business, or was it an industry-wide issue? And what specific measures did you take to mitigate the impact of those delays?

**Luigi:** That was a challenging period, no doubt.  The supply chain disruptions were widespread across the industry, not just us.  We had major delays in getting essential components, like compressors and control systems.  It pushed back project timelines and put pressure on margins.  To mitigate the impact, we worked closely with our suppliers, explored alternative sourcing options, and communicated proactively with our clients to manage expectations.

**David:** And the more marginal growth in the most recent financial year, was that a conscious decision to slow down, or were there other factors at play?  We’re trying to understand the consistency of your growth strategy and how you see the business developing in the next few years.

[00:10:00] **Ian:** It was partly a conscious decision.  After the hectic growth spurt, we wanted to consolidate, focus on quality, and ensure we weren't overstretching our resources.  But there were also external factors.  The economic slowdown had an impact, with some clients delaying or scaling back their projects.  Looking ahead, we're cautiously optimistic.  We see opportunities in the market, particularly in the renewable energy sector, but we'll be taking a measured approach to growth.

**Emily:** You mentioned renewable energy.  Could you elaborate on that?  What specific areas are you exploring, and what kind of investment are you considering?

**Luigi:** We're definitely seeing increased demand for sustainable HVAC solutions.  Clients are more environmentally conscious, and there are also financial incentives with government grants and schemes.  We're exploring solar thermal, heat pumps, and energy-efficient ventilation systems.  We've already started training our engineers on these technologies, and we're looking at partnerships with specialist suppliers.  Investment-wise, it's an ongoing process.  We're allocating resources to R&D, training, and potentially expanding our product portfolio.

**Sarah:** That's interesting.  Now, let's go back to the invoicing process.  You mentioned it varies depending on the project size.  For the larger projects with staged payments, how do you determine the percentage of completion at each stage?  And what controls are in place to ensure accurate and timely invoicing?

[00:15:00] **Ian:** We have a robust system for tracking progress on large projects.  It involves detailed project plans, milestones, regular site visits, and meticulous record-keeping.  We use a combination of project management software and good old-fashioned spreadsheets.  Our engineers provide regular updates, and our project managers oversee the whole process.  For each stage, we assess the percentage of completion based on various factors - materials used, labor hours, key milestones achieved.  We have a standard template and a clear approval process to ensure accuracy and timeliness.

**David:** And for the smaller quoted jobs, what's the typical payment terms?  Do you require upfront payments, or is it all on completion?

**Luigi:** For smaller jobs, it's usually payment on completion.  We might ask for a small deposit for materials on larger quoted jobs, but generally, we invoice once the work is done and the client is happy.  We try to keep the payment process simple and straightforward.

**Emily:** Moving on to the WIP, the work-in-progress, you provide a summary to your accountants at year-end.  Can we see some examples of those summaries, and could you walk us through the methodology used to calculate the completion percentage?  We want to understand how you ensure the WIP is accurately valued at year-end.

**Ian:** Sure, we can provide some examples.  They’re quite detailed, showing the estimated stage of completion for each project, the costs incurred to date, and the estimated revenue to be recognized.  The methodology is based on a combination of factors, including labor hours, materials used, and professional judgment from our project managers.  We have a standard template and a rigorous review process to ensure accuracy.

[00:20:00] **Sarah:** That's helpful.  Now, regarding the PPM contracts, the Planned Preventive Maintenance, we see a mix of contract lengths and billing frequencies.  Can you explain the rationale behind that?  Is it driven by client preference, or are there other factors?  And what's the average contract length and renewal rate?

**Luigi:** It's mainly driven by client preference.  Some clients prefer the simplicity of annual billing, while others prefer to spread the cost with monthly or quarterly payments.  We try to be flexible and accommodate their needs.  The average contract length is around 18 months, but we have some clients who have been with us for years on rolling annual contracts.  Our renewal rate is pretty high, around 85%, which we're proud of.  We strive to build strong relationships with our clients and provide excellent service.

**David:** That's impressive.  Now, shifting gears to costs, you mentioned minimal reliance on subcontractors.  Can you clarify how you manage peak demand periods without relying heavily on subcontractors?  Do you utilize overtime, temporary staff, or other strategies?

**Ian:** We have a core team of skilled engineers, and we manage their schedules carefully to optimize efficiency.  We also have some flexibility in our working hours, so we can extend them when needed.  We do use overtime when necessary, but we try to avoid it to prevent burnout and maintain morale.  We also have a pool of trusted freelance engineers we can call on if we need extra help during peak periods.  But our preference is to handle most of the work with our in-house team.

**Emily:** Regarding the bad debt write-off from a couple of years ago, what steps have you taken to mitigate that risk in the future?  Have you implemented any credit insurance or stricter credit control procedures?

[00:25:00] **Luigi:** We learned a valuable lesson from that experience.  We've tightened our credit checks and implemented stricter payment terms.  We now conduct more thorough due diligence on new clients, especially larger ones.  We also try to build strong relationships with our clients and maintain open communication about their financial situation.  We haven't implemented credit insurance yet, but it's something we're considering.  We're also exploring alternative invoicing and payment solutions to minimize the risk of late payments and bad debts.

**Sarah:** We’ve noticed some fluctuations in material costs.  Can you explain what drives those variations, and do you have any hedging strategies in place to manage price volatility?

**Ian:** The HVAC industry is subject to price fluctuations, especially for certain components like compressors and refrigerants.  Global supply chains, raw material costs, and even currency exchange rates can all play a role.  We try to negotiate fixed prices with our suppliers whenever possible, but it's not always feasible.  We don't have any formal hedging strategies in place at the moment, but we do try to anticipate price increases and buy materials in bulk when it makes sense.  We're also exploring alternative materials and suppliers to mitigate the impact of price volatility.

**David:** We came across an invoice for a client called ‘Northern Breeze Solutions,’ but we couldn’t find them in Companies House.  Can you clarify who they are?  And more broadly, how do you verify the legitimacy of your smaller clients and manage credit risk for those smaller accounts?

[00:30:00] **Luigi:** Ah, yes, Northern Breeze Solutions.  That’s a trading name for a smaller company.  They operate in a niche market and don’t have a formal company registration.  For smaller clients, we rely on referrals and word-of-mouth.  We also check their credit history, ask for references, and sometimes request upfront payments or deposits, depending on the size and scope of the work.

**Emily:** You’ve mentioned a potential expansion into renewable energy solutions.  Can you elaborate on your plans?  What specific technologies are you considering, and what's your timeline for entering this market?

**Ian:** We're excited about the potential in renewable energy.  We see it as a natural extension of our existing expertise in HVAC.  We're exploring various technologies, including solar thermal, heat pumps, and energy-efficient ventilation systems.  We're also looking at smart home integration and building management systems that optimize energy consumption.  We're currently in the research and development phase, conducting pilot projects and evaluating different solutions.  We don't have a firm timeline for full-scale market entry, but we're aiming to introduce some new offerings within the next year or two.

**Sarah:** And the potential new warehouse in Leeds, what’s the latest on that project?  What are the projected costs and benefits, and how will it impact your logistics and operations?

[00:35:00] **Luigi:** The warehouse project is still in the planning phase.  We're currently finalizing the site selection and negotiating with potential developers.  We need to secure funding and obtain the necessary permits, which can take time.  The projected costs are significant, but we believe it will be a worthwhile investment.  The new warehouse will allow us to consolidate our inventory, improve our logistics, and expand our service area.  We're also considering incorporating some green building features and renewable energy technologies into the design.  We're hoping to start construction within the next 12-18 months.

**David:** Regarding the IT infrastructure, we’ve noticed a mix of legacy systems and newer software.  Are you planning to upgrade or consolidate your systems?  And what are your data backup and disaster recovery plans?  We're particularly interested in how you protect client data and ensure business continuity in case of a cyberattack or other disruption.

**Ian:** You're right, our IT infrastructure is a bit of a patchwork at the moment.  We're in the process of transitioning to a new integrated system that will streamline our operations and enhance our data security.  It's a major undertaking, but we're making good progress.  We have regular data backups, both on-site and off-site, and we're working on a more comprehensive disaster recovery plan that includes cybersecurity measures, data recovery procedures, and alternative communication systems.  We're committed to protecting our client data and ensuring business continuity.

**Emily:** And regarding data security, we’ve noticed some files were unencrypted.  What are your plans to improve data protection?  Do you conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments?  And what kind of employee training do you provide on data security best practices?

[00:40:00] **Luigi:** We understand the importance of data security, and we're taking steps to enhance our protection measures.  We're implementing encryption protocols for all sensitive data, both in transit and at rest.  We're also strengthening our access controls and implementing multi-factor authentication.  We haven't conducted regular security audits in the past, but we're planning to implement them, potentially with the help of an external cybersecurity firm.  We're also developing a comprehensive data security policy and providing regular training to our staff on data security best practices, including password management, phishing awareness, and social engineering prevention.

**Sarah:** That's reassuring.  Now, to get a more hands-on understanding of your operations, we’d like to schedule a site visit.  When would be a convenient time, and could we see the workshop, warehouse areas, and perhaps even observe some of your engineers working on a project?

**Ian:** Absolutely, a site visit would be very helpful.  We're flexible on timing.  Just let us know your preferred dates, and we'll make it work.  You're welcome to see the workshop and warehouse areas, and we can definitely arrange for you to observe some of our engineers in action.  We can even introduce you to some of our key clients if you're interested.

**David:** That would be great.  Finally, regarding the relationship between the shareholders, we’d like to understand the roles and responsibilities of each of you in more detail.  Could you provide some insight into how you divide the workload and decision-making authority?  And how do you manage any disagreements or conflicts that may arise?

[00:45:00] **Luigi:** As you know, Ian and I are the active shareholders involved in the day-to-day operations.  We have a good working relationship and complementary skills.  I focus more on the larger installation projects, business development, and strategic planning, while Ian handles the maintenance contracts, operations, and financial management.  Gina and Nicole, our wives, are passive shareholders.  They're involved in the strategic direction and major investment decisions, but they don't participate in the daily running of the business.  We have regular board meetings where we discuss all major decisions and resolve any disagreements through open and honest communication.  We value each other's opinions and strive to reach consensus.

**Ian:** We've been in business together for many years, and we have a strong foundation of trust and mutual respect.  We understand each other's strengths and weaknesses, and we work together effectively.  We also have a clear governance structure in place, with defined roles and responsibilities.  Of course, we have occasional disagreements, but we always try to resolve them constructively and in the best interests of the company.

**Sarah:** That's very helpful.  We appreciate your transparency and openness.  We have a much clearer picture of your operations and management structure now.  We have a few more questions about your financial projections and future plans, but we can save those for another discussion.

**Luigi:** No problem, we're happy to answer any questions you have.  We want to make sure you have all the information you need to complete your due diligence.

**Ian:** Absolutely.  We're confident in the future of our business, and we're excited about the opportunities ahead.

[00:50:00] **Sarah:** We appreciate your time and cooperation.  We'll be in touch soon to schedule the site visit and follow up on the remaining questions.

**Luigi:** We look forward to it.

**Ian:** Thanks for your thoroughness.  We appreciate your professionalism.
