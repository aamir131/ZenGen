      "Europe Air Conditioning Ltd (EAC) includes several direct expenses within their cost of sales. From the provided data table, cost components encompass Direct Expenses, CIS Labour, CIS Materials, Plant Hire, and Subcontractors. Management has emphasized a minimal reliance on subcontractors, typically handling projects with their in-house team and only occasionally using freelance engineers during peak demand periods. This approach aligns with their strategy to maintain cost control and efficiency. The subcontractor and CIS Labour combined account for a diminishing percentage of the total cost of sales, reducing from 13% in FY22 and FY23 to 6% in FY24, likely reflecting better resource management and less outsourcing over time.\n"
