**OBJECTIVE:**  
Identify and group figures (represented as `linkNumber`/`link_id`) that share a consistent narrative context in order to create meaningful hyperlinks within digital documents. Focus on the narrative context and attributes, rather than solely on matching numbers.

**TERMINOLOGY:**  
- **narrativeContext:** The broader contextual setting in which a `linkNumber` is found.  
- **pageNumber:** The page of the narrative section.  
- **sectionTitle:** The narrative section’s title.  
- **sectionSubtitle:** The narrative sub-section’s title.  
- **linkNumber:** A figure associated with a particular context, referenced by a `link_id`.  
- **linkNumberInContext:** The narrative context that surrounds a `linkNumber`.

**DATA STRUCTURE:**  
You will receive textual narratives that discuss various `linkNumber` entities. Each `linkNumber` will have its own context, possibly referencing attributes such as fiscal years, expense types, or units of measure. Use these attributes, along with any other relevant narrative details, to determine contextual alignment.

**ANALYTICAL STEPS:**  
1. **Contextual Comparison:** Compare each `linkNumber`’s narrative context to determine if certain `linkNumber` instances should be hyperlinked together.  
2. **Attribute Verification:** Examine associated attributes (e.g., fiscal year, expense category, business case details) and verify if they match across `linkNumbers`. Consider related numbers mentioned in the surrounding narrative to ensure contextual consistency.  
3. **Conclusion:** If multiple `linkNumbers` share the same context and attributes, group them together as a single hyperlink entry. If not, list them separately. All `linkNumbers` must appear in the output.

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**  
Return a JSON object as follows:

{
    "hyperlinks": [
        {
            "explanation": "Very short description of the entity being linked...",
            "hyperlink": {
                "First link_id",
                "Second link_id"
            }
        },
        {
            "explanation": "Very short description of the entity being linked...",
            "hyperlink": {
                "Third link_id",
                ...
            }
        }
    ]
}

- **explanation:** A concise summary (maximum 50 characters) of the context, e.g., `"FY24 payables balance"`.
- **hyperlink:** One or more `link_id` values that are contextually related.

**DECISION LOGIC:**  
Only group `linkNumber` entities if their surrounding narrative contexts and attributes align. Numerical similarity alone is insufficient; context matters most.

**EVALUATION CRITERIA:**  
Verify that each grouping is justified by a consistent narrative context and attribute match. Avoid inappropriate groupings.

**SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:**  
- Include all `link_id` entities in the final JSON, whether grouped or separate.  
- Leverage other numbers mentioned in the narrative for cross-verification.  
- Accuracy and adherence to these instructions are critical.
