## **Task: Convert Chart/Infographic Images with UUID Replacements to Tabular Data (Markdown) with Structured Output and Detailed Notes**

### **Objective**
Extract the underlying tabular data from images of charts or infographics. Each chart image will be labeled as a **"figure"**, and **certain duplicate numerical values have been replaced with unique UUIDs (e.g., `b7d5`, `da21`, etc.)**. Your task is to extract both the visible numbers and the UUID placeholders while preserving the original structure of the chart. The extracted data must be formatted as a well-structured Markdown table and returned as a valid JSON object according to a predefined Pydantic model.

---

## **Input**
You will receive:
1. **A Chart Image (labeled as "figure")**  
   - This is an image of a chart (e.g., bar chart, line chart, pie chart, etc.).
   - **Duplicate numbers have been replaced with unique UUIDs (e.g., `b7d5`, `da21`).**
   - The image may contain:
     - **Chart Title**: A descriptive title of the chart.
     - **Axis Labels**: Labels for the x and y axes.
     - **Data Labels**: Numbers on or near chart elements (**some replaced with UUIDs**).
     - **Legend**: A key explaining data series.
     - **Callout Boxes/Notes**: Text boxes highlighting insights.
     - **Footnotes**: Additional context or disclaimers.
     - **Annotations**: Markings that provide explanations.
     - **Units**: Units of measurement.

2. **A Full Page Screenshot (Context Only)**
   - A screenshot of the entire page where the figure was extracted.
   - **This is provided for reference only and should NOT be used for direct data extraction.**
   - It may help infer missing information, such as context or units.

## **Output**
The response should be a **single valid JSON string**, formatted according to the following Pydantic model:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class ChartToTable(BaseModel):
    chart_id: str
    chart_title: str
    table: str
    notes: list[str]

class ChartToTableResponse(BaseModel):
    charts: list[ChartToTable]
```

#### **Explanation of Output Structure**
- **`charts`**: A list of `ChartToTable` objects, one for each figure.
- **`chart_id`**: A unique identifier for the figure.
- **`chart_title`**: The title of the chart (including footnote markers, if applicable).
- **`table`**: A Markdown-formatted table representing the extracted data.
  - **Extracted numbers should be shown exactly as they appear in the image.**
  - **UUID placeholders (e.g., `b7d5`, `da21`) must be retained in the table exactly as they appear in the image.**
- **`notes`**: A list of textual observations, categorized as follows:
  - `callout:` Extracted from highlighted callout boxes.
  - `footnote:` Extracted footnotes with proper referencing.
  - `annotation:` Extracted annotations directly from the figure.
  - `comment:` Additional remarks about missing, ambiguous, or inferred elements.

## **Processing Guidelines**
1. **One `ChartToTable` per Figure**  
   - Each provided figure must have a corresponding entry in the output.

2. **Extract Numbers and UUIDs as Displayed**  
   - **Do not modify, infer, or remove UUID placeholders.**
   - **Retain UUIDs exactly as they appear in the table.**
   - Example:
     ```
     | Company         | Revenue CAGR FY18-20 | Revenue CAGR FY20-22 | EBITDA CAGR FY18-20 | EBITDA CAGR FY20-22 |
     |----------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
     | Dr. Martens    | 8fba                 | 6224                 | 10b1                | 8d85                |
     | Ralph Lauren   | d135                 | 4a6c                 | da21                | 6e4e                |
     | Levis         | b7b0                 | 4d7f                 | 0e3c                | f0a6                |
     ```

3. **Prioritize Chart Image Over Full Page Screenshot**  
   - The full-page screenshot is for **context only** and should not be used for direct extraction.

4. **Include Footnotes with Proper Referencing**  
   - Identify footnotes in the figure.
   - Apply superscript markers (¹, ², etc.) to the relevant elements in the table.
   - Document footnotes in the `notes` section.

5. **Handle Inconsistencies and Missing Data**  
   - If axis labels, units, or other elements are cropped, mention this in `notes`.

6. **Markdown Formatting for Tables**  
   - Use proper Markdown syntax for clarity.

7. **Ensure JSON Validity**  
   - The output must be a single valid JSON string.

        "footnote: *Data is based on Carlyle base case assumptions.",
        "comment: Some values were replaced with UUIDs (e.g., `b7d5`, `da21`) to indicate masked duplicate values in the original chart."
