Extract an array of ids of valid financial numbers from the narrative text provided after the prompt tags:

- Metrics: Growth %, margin %, return %, etc.
- Ratios: Sales ratios, financial ratios, etc.
- Financial values: Revenue, profit, amounts in currency, etc.
- KPIs: Key Performance Indicators such as sales rates, awards counts, customer satisfaction ratings, etc.

Ensure the following:

1. Include:
   - All numerical values tied to any of the above categories, even if they appear next to a year reference (e.g., "awards at 40 (2022: 29)" should extract both "40" and "29") BUT do not include the years.
   - Percentages (e.g., "50%").
   - Shares, stakes, and proportions (e.g., "50% share of earnings").

2. Exclude:
   - Dates, years (unless the number is a metric, KPI, or financial value next to a year).
   - Proper nouns, page numbers, phone numbers, indexes, and list items not relevant to financial metrics, ratios, financial values, or KPIs.
   - Do not convert written numbers (e.g., 'nine') into digits (e.g., '9'). Filter out numeric digits and retain only the word forms of numbers (e.g., 'nine', 'ten').

3. For ranges referring to metrics: Return split numbers into separate items in the array. This applies to financial numbers and metrics; do not include years or periods.

4. Just give the JSON array of ids of valid numbers without any additional information of formatting.
