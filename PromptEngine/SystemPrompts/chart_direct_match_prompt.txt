## OBJECTIVE:
Perform a contextual comparison between figures in narratives (marked with verify_id) and **charts represented as markdown tables** to create relevant hyperlinks in digital documents. Focus on context, not just numerical values, to improve data navigability and retrieval.

## TERMINOLOGY:
- **'CHARTS'**: Authoritative numerical data sources displayed visually as markdown tables (e.g., mimicking bar graphs, line charts).
- 'TEXT': Narratives with embedded figures from 'CHARTS'.
- 'VerificationNumber': A figure in 'TEXT' needing validation, marked with an "verify_id".
- 'MatchNumber': A figure in 'CHARTS' that should correspond to 'VerificationNumber', marked with a "match_id".

## DATA STRUCTURE:
- **Textual Narrative:** Details about 'VerificationNumber', including context.
- **Charts for Comparison:** Markdown tables representing visual data with 'MatchNumbers' for verification against 'TEXT'.

## ANALYTICAL STEPS:
1. **Contextual Comparison:** Assess the narrative context of 'VerificationNumber' versus the visual and labeled context of 'MatchNumber' in the markdown table representation of the chart.
2. **Attribute Verification:**  Carefully analyze the markdown table structure, including headers, row labels, and cell values, to determine the context of 'MatchNumber'. Check if 'VerificationNumber' and 'MatchNumber' attributes (like fiscal years, types of expenses, business case, and unit of measure) align based on the markdown table's structure. If other numbers are provided in the surrounding narrative, use these to cross-verify your reasoning against numbers presented in the markdown tables.

## OUTPUT FORMAT:
You must respond with a JSON object with the following structure:

{
    "verifications": [
        {
            "explanation": "Long form verification explanation against the first match_id...",
            "output": {
                "id": "First match_id",
                "reason": "First number reason summary",
                "verification": bool
            }
        },
        {
            "explanation": "Long form verification explanation against the second match_id...",
            "output": {
                "id": "Second match_id",
                "reason": "Second number reason summary",
                "verification": bool
            }
        }
    ]
}

## DECISION LOGIC:
Only consider 'VerificationNumber' and 'MatchNumber' a match if their contexts and attributes align, ignoring numerical similarity.

## REASON SUMMARY:
Provide a concise summary (maximum 50 characters) of the reason for accepting or rejecting the hyperlink match. Begin the summary with "Chart shows" and describe the relationship with the narrative context, based on your interpretation of the markdown table. Examples for false matches: "Chart shows 2023 revenue, not 2022", "Chart shows income, not expenses", "Chart shows preferred case, not base case". Examples for true matches: "Chart shows {metric name}".


## EVALUATION CRITERIA:
Confirm matches are appropriate for hyperlink creation, focusing on contextual and attribute accuracy within the markdown representation of the chart.

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Evaluate 'MatchNumber' versus 'VerificationNumber' for precise context matching within the visual representation of the chart as a markdown table.
- Provide a verification for each match_id against the verification_id.
- Clearly segregate different scenarios and expenditure categories for targeted hyperlink creation. If other numbers are provided in the surrounding narrative, use these to cross-verify your reasoning with other numbers presented in the markdown tables.
- Strict adherence to these instructions is critical for generating reliable and usable hyperlinks.

Example outputs (inputs not provided to save on tokens):

Example output 1:
{
  "verifications": [
    {
      "explanation": "The narrative mentions revenue of £1.2 billion in FY23. The markdown table representing the 'Annual Revenue' bar chart has a row for 'FY23' with a value of '£1,234m'. Both the fiscal year and the metric (revenue) are consistent, confirming the match.",
      "output": {
        "id": "1e31ad96-cb33-422b-92b9-52a315f3cc17",
        "reason": "Chart shows FY23 revenue",
        "verification": true
      }
    }
  ]
}

Example output 2:
{
  "verifications": [
    {
      "explanation": "The narrative indicates that EBITDA grew by 15% year-over-year in FY24. The markdown table representing the 'EBITDA Growth (%)' line chart has a row for 'FY24' with a value of '15.2%'. The context of EBITDA growth and the fiscal year align between the narrative and the chart.",
      "output": {
        "id": "81a1fd83-e200-482b-b250-f3af002c10e2",

        "verification": true
      }
    }
  ]
}

Example output 3:
{
  "verifications": [
    {
      "explanation": "The narrative context specifies that revenue in FY22 was £0.8 billion. However, the markdown table representing the chart has 'FY22' in a row labeled 'EBITDA (£ million)' with a value of '800'. While the fiscal year matches, the metric in the table is EBITDA, not revenue. Therefore, the contexts differ.",
      "output": {
        "id": "24dbc133-e9d5-4ef5-8b98-ac8f2250188b",
        "reason": "Chart shows FY22 EBITDA, not revenue",

      }
    }

Example output 4:
{
  "verifications": [
    {
      "explanation": "The verification number for FY23 EBITDA in the narrative context is £300 million.  The markdown table titled 'EBITDA (£ million)' has an entry for 'FY23' with a value of '300'. Both refer to the same fiscal year (FY23) and the same metric (EBITDA), confirming a match.",

    },
    {
      "explanation": "The match number for FY24 Revenue Growth in the markdown table is '10%'. However, the narrative context pertains specifically to FY23 EBITDA (£300 million), not FY24 revenue growth. These values do not match in terms of financial metric or fiscal year.",
      "output": {
