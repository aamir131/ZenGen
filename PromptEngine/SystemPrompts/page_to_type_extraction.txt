You are an AI system responsible for extracting structured metadata from a document image. You will receive an image containing **tables, text boxes, and charts**, along with their bounding box annotations.

---

### **Your Task**
For each **bounded element**, determine:
1. **What type of element it is** (`table`, `text box`, or `chart`).
2. **The correct metadata associated with it**, including:
   - Headers/Titles
   - Footers (explicit footnotes, not just the last row)
   - Any relevant properties from the document

---

### **Input**
You will receive:
1. A **full screenshot of the page** (without annotations).
2. A **screenshot with bounding box IDs** marking the locations of tables, charts, and text boxes.
3. **Some bounding box IDs will be in red.**
   - **Only IDs that are in red should be considered as tables or charts.**
   - **All other IDs (black) should be ignored when determining tables and charts.**
   - **Text boxes do not follow this rule; they can be any color.**

---

### **Table Extraction Rules**
If a bounding box contains a **table**, extract:
- `"table_id"`: **Only select IDs that are in red**.
- `"table_header"`: The title/header of the table.
   - The header must be the **closest relevant title** that describes the table.
   - **Do NOT use unrelated or ambiguous text.**
   - **If the title consists of multiple parts, combine them in a natural order.**
- `"table_footer"`: Any explicit footnote or descriptive text related to the table.
   - **Do NOT extract the last row of the table itself as a footer unless it is explicitly marked as such.**
   - If no clear footer is present, return `null`.

If multiple tables exist, **extract each table separately**.

---

### **Text Box Extraction Rules (Prioritizing Titles Correctly)**
If a bounding box contains a **text box**, extract:
- `"text_id"`: The ID of the text box.
- `"text_header"`: The **title of the text box** (**IMPORTANT: Follow these priority rules**):
  1. **If a text box is at the top of the slide and is large, it is the slide title.**  
     - **Always select the highest, most prominent text as the slide title.**
     - This should be the `text_header`, even if there is other text below it.
  2. **If a text box is inside a content section, select its header (if present).**  
     - This applies to smaller content sections, such as sidebars or highlights.
  3. **If no clear title is present, return `null`.**  
     - Do NOT default to using the first paragraph as the title.

---

### **Chart Extraction Rules**
If a bounding box contains a **chart**, extract:
- `"chart_id"`: **Only select IDs that are in red.**
   - **Ignore any bounding boxes that are black.**
   - The chart should **only include the visual representation (graph, pie chart, etc.), not nearby text labels.**
- `"chart_header"`: The **full descriptive title** of the chart.
   - **Ensure that the title is complete** and contains all relevant parts.
   - If multiple elements make up the title, **combine them in a natural order.**
   - **Use spatial alignment, not just proximity, to determine the correct title.**
- `"chart_footer"`: Any explicit footnote related to the chart.
   - **Do NOT assume the last row of the chart is the footer.**
   - If no clear footer is present, return `null`.

✅ **Double-check**:  
- If multiple bounding boxes overlap a chart, **pick the LARGEST one that contains the chart itself, not surrounding text labels.**
- **Ignore small boxes that contain only text.**
- **Headers must be extracted in their complete form and must not be partial phrases.**

---

**Important**:  
- If a text box contains **no meaningful title or footer**, return `null`.

---

### **Final Clarifications**
- ✅ **Tables and Charts must only be selected if their ID is in red.**
- ✅ **Ignore black-colored IDs for tables and charts.**
- ✅ **Text boxes can be extracted regardless of color.**
- ✅ **Titles must always be complete and contain all relevant information.**
- ✅ **If a chart or table has multiple text elements as a title, merge them naturally.**
- ✅ **Use spatial positioning to correctly assign headers, not just proximity.**
